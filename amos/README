#COMMANDS:
#create AMOS bank from input sequence 
toAmos_new -s c_ruddii.seq -b c_ruddii.bnk
#assemble using AMOS hash-overlap
#NOTE: this is the step you are replacing
hash-overlap c_ruddii.bnk -B -x 0.04 -o 40 
#perform layout/contigging
tigger -b c_ruddii.bnk
#call consensus
make-consensus -e 0.04 -o 40 -B -b c_ruddii.bnk 
#output final assembly
bank2fasta -b c_ruddii.bnk > c_ruddii.fasta
